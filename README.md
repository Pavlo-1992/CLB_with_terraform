In this project, I’ve provisioned:

A VPC, subnets, route tables, and an Internet Gateway

Two EC2 instances running NGINX

Security groups for the load balancer and instances

A Classic Load Balancer with health checks

Automated user-data configuration for each server

One command → full infrastructure
